meta-dpdk
=========

This README file contains information on building and booting
meta-intel BSP layers.  Please see the corresponding sections below
for details.


Yocto Project Compatible
========================

The BSPs contained in this layer are compatible with the Yocto Project
as per the requirements listed here:

  https://www.yoctoproject.org/webform/yocto-project-compatible-registration


Dependencies
============

This layer depends on:

  URI: git://git.openembedded.org/bitbake
  branch: 1.34

  URI: git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
  layers: meta
  branch: pyro


Guidelines for submitting patches
====================================

Please submit any patches against meta-dpdk to the meta-intel
mailing list (meta-intel@yoctoproject.org).  Also, if your patches are
available via a public git repository, please also include a URL to
the repo and branch containing your patches as that makes it easier
for maintainers to grab and test your patches.

There are patch submission scripts available that will, among other
things, automatically include the repo URL and branch as mentioned.
Please see the Yocto Project Development Manual sections entitled
'Using Scripts to Push a Change Upstream and Request a Pull' and
'Using Email to Submit a Patch' for details.

Regardless of how you submit a patch or patchset, the patches should
at minimum follow the suggestions outlined in the 'Submitting a Change
to the Yocto Project' section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.
Specifically, they should:

  - Include a 'Signed-off-by:' line.  A commit can't legally be pulled
    in without this.

  - Provide a single-line, short summary of the change.  This short
    description should be prefixed by the BSP or recipe name, as
    appropriate, followed by a colon.  Capitalize the first character
    of the summary (following the colon).

  - For the body of the commit message, provide detailed information
    that describes what you changed, why you made the change, and the
    approach you used.

  - If the change addresses a specific bug or issue that is associated
    with a bug-tracking ID, include a reference to that ID in your
    detailed description in the following format: [YOCTO #<bug-id>].

  - Pay attention to line length - please don't allow any particular
    line in the commit message to stretch past 72 characters.

  - For any non-trivial patch, provide information about how you
    tested the patch, and for any non-trivial or non-obvious testing
    setup, provide details of that setup.

Doing a quick 'git log' in meta-intel will provide you with many
examples of good example commits if you have questions about any
aspect of the preferred format.

The meta-intel maintainers will do their best to review and/or pull in
a patch or patchset within 24 hours of the time it was posted.  For
larger and/or more involved patches and patchsets, the review process
may take longer.

Please see the meta-intel/MAINTAINERS file for the list of maintainers
and their specific areas; it's also a good idea to cc: the specific
maintainer, if applicable.
